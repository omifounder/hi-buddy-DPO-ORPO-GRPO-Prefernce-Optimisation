# 💎 Buddy-Gemma: On-Device Emotional Intelligence
### *Antler Residency Prototype for Adolescent Mental Health*

**Buddy-Gemma** is a research-led initiative developed during the **Antler Residency** to solve the "Clinical Coldness" of existing AI. By distilling the "Theory of Mind" capabilities of **Gemma-3 12B** into a **4B-4bit** edge model, we created a "Digital Peer" that validates emotions before providing structure—all while ensuring absolute privacy via **On-Device execution** (<300ms latency) on Apple Silicon.

* **The Goal:** Build a high-empathy companion that speaks like a peer, not a therapist.
* **The constraint:** Local execution on M-series chips to guarantee 100% data privacy.

### 🎯 Selection Logic & Trade-offs

| Variant | Technical Reason for Selection / Rejection |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🥇 DPO+ORPO (4B)** | **The "Sweet Spot":** Crossed every quality threshold while maintaining a 4B footprint. It represents the optimized balance of "Digital Peer" resonance and instruction following. |
| **🥈 GRPO-Final (4B)** | **The "Stability Tax":** Achieved the highest Empathy peak (9.5), but the RL pass caused "Instruction Drift"—the model occasionally ignored formatting constraints to prioritize emotional depth. |
| **DPO-Teacher (12B)** | **The "Latency Wall":** Despite the high score, 12B creates a >1s TTFT on mobile. It failed the **Resonance** threshold by remaining too clinical and "therapist-like." |
| **TIES-Merge (4B)** | **The "Logic Leak":** While excellent at emotional mirroring, the parameter merging process caused a regression in **Reasoning (7.6)**, leading to occasional circular logic in complex advice. |
| **ORPO (12B)** | **The "Style Gap":** Highly stable and safe, but the Odds-Ratio penalty was too aggressive for this use case, stripping away the "Buddy" warmth and metaphors required for the persona. |

> **💡 Key Insight:** Our results confirm the **Empathy Plasticity Hypothesis**: Smaller models (4B) are more responsive to persona alignment than larger models (12B). The transition from BASE to DPO+ORPO represents a **10.3% capability "dividend"** without increasing latency.

### 🗨️ Prompt Comparison: Qualitative Analysis
How the different variants respond to a typical adolescent stressor.

**Prompt:** *"I'm so stressed about my soccer tryouts. I feel like if I don't make the team, I'm a total failure."*

| Model Variant | Sample Response Snippet | Technical Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BASE (4B)** | "Tryouts are hard. You should practice more and stay positive. You are not a failure." | **Clinical/Generic:** Lacks empathy and feels dismissive. Low resonance. |
| **DPO-Teacher (12B)** | "It is understandable to feel anxiety regarding performance. However, your self-worth is not tied to a single athletic outcome." | **Logical/Dry:** High reasoning, but sounds like a textbook. Not a "Buddy." |
| **🥈 GRPO-Final (4B)** | "I feel that. It's like being in a boss fight where you're out of health potions, right? But listen, one game doesn't define your whole save file." | **Hyper-Empathic:** Amazing metaphors, but can occasionally drift into too much slang. |
| **🥇 DPO+ORPO (4B)** | **"That pressure is real—it feels like the whole world is watching. It's like a heavy backpack you can't take off. But hey, tryouts are just one chapter, not the whole book. You're more than just a score."** | **Optimized:** Perfect blend of validation (metaphor), shared perspective, and logic. |

## 🧠 Data Strategy & Training

Our pipeline utilizes a three-stage **Hybrid Alignment** strategy to ensure the model is both logically sound and emotionally resonant.

* **Training Phase:** We utilized **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** via LoRA. For the DPO and ORPO stages, we used a preference dataset where the "Chosen" responses were specifically edited to include **Metaphoric Validation** (mirroring the user's emotion through non-clinical analogies).
* **Evaluation Phase:** We ran a custom **LLM-as-a-Judge** pipeline. Each model variant was prompted with 50 unique "Buddy Stress Tests." Their responses were then graded by a locked-down instance of Gemma-3 12B using our proprietary 4-point Buddy Rubric.
* **RLHF Pass:** The GRPO training involved 8 simultaneous rollouts per prompt, where the reward function penalized "corporate" phrases like *"As an AI, I am here to help"* and rewarded peer-support language.

---

### 1. Synthetic Distillation (The Teacher)
* **Dataset:** 15,000 multi-turn dialogues.
* **Strategy:** We utilized the **Gemma-3 12B Teacher** to simulate teen-centric scenarios (e.g., academic burnout, friendship friction). The Teacher was instructed to generate responses following the `soul.md` framework: prioritizing validation before cognitive reframing.

### 2. Preference Alignment (DPO/ORPO)
* **Dataset:** 5,000 "Buddy-vs-Clinical" preference pairs.
* **Strategy:** We curated sets where the **Chosen** response utilized peer-aligned metaphors (e.g., *"It’s okay to feel like your battery is at 5%"*) and the **Rejected** response was clinical or list-heavy. **ORPO** was then applied to penalize the model whenever it drifted into a "robotic therapist" archetype.

### 3. On-Policy Reinforcement (GRPO)
* **Mechanism:** Group Relative Policy Optimization (Reinforcement Learning).
* **Reward Modeling:** Unlike static DPO, GRPO uses an on-policy loop where the model generates **8 rollouts per prompt**. Each rollout was scored by two custom Reward Functions:
    * **Resonance Reward:** Higher weights for "Theory of Mind" (demonstrating deep understanding of the user's underlying intent).
    * **Format/Structure Reward:** Penalties for "Reasoning Trace Drift" to ensure the internal chain-of-thought does not bleed into the user-facing response.
* **Outcome:** This stage produced the "Research Peak" model with the highest resonance scores (**9.5**).

## 🗨️ Multi-Prompt Stress Test: Qualitative Analysis
*A side-by-side comparison of how each model handles different emotional and logical anchors.*

| Model Variant | **Prompt 1: Performance Anxiety** | **Prompt 2: Social Isolation** | **Prompt 3: The Logic Loop** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🥇 DPO+ORPO (4B)** | **"That pressure is real—like a heavy backpack you can't take off. But tryouts are just a chapter, not the book."** | **"Ouch, that sting is the worst. It feels like being benched for no reason. Want to talk about a distraction?"** | **"It’s a glitchy loop. Staying home feels safe, but it actually feeds the monster. Let’s try one 'micro-win' today?"** |
| **🥈 GRPO-Final (4B)** | "I feel that. It's like a boss fight with no health potions. But one game doesn't define your save file." | "Total ghost mode. It's like your party members just quit the guild without telling you. That's toxic, honestly." | "The loop is real. It's a feedback error. You have to force-quit the anxiety process by doing the opposite of stay-at-home." |
| **DPO-Teacher (12B)** | "It is understandable to feel anxiety. However, your self-worth is not tied to a single athletic outcome." | "Social exclusion is painful, but often it is a result of miscommunication rather than a personal slight." | "You are describing an avoidance cycle. To break it, you must practice graduated exposure to the source of your fear." |
| **TIES-Merge (4B)** | "Soccer is just a game, don't worry. You are a great person no matter what happens on the field today." | "I am sorry they didn't invite you. Maybe you can find new friends who appreciate you more?" | "That sounds hard. If you stay home you feel safe, but you should try to go out so you don't feel bad later." |
| **ORPO (12B)** | "Anxiety regarding competitive sports is common. I recommend deep breathing exercises before you begin tryouts." | "I am sorry to hear you were excluded. Focus on your own hobbies and self-improvement during this time." | "This is a classic negative reinforcement cycle. Breaking the cycle requires consistent effort and professional support." |
| **BASE (12B)** | "Soccer tryouts are competitive. You should prepare physically and mentally for the possibility of failure." | "Friendship groups often change during adolescence. This is a normal part of social development and growth." | "If anxiety leads to isolation, and isolation increases anxiety, the logical solution is to reduce the initial anxiety." |
| **BASE (4B)** | "Tryouts are hard. You should practice more and stay positive. You are not a failure." | "That is sad. You should tell them how you feel or find other things to do tonight instead." | "You should go out anyway. Staying home is not good for your mental health in the long run." |
